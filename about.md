#Hi,

My name is Yago Riveiro, I'm a spanish guy living in the great city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto">Porto</a> since 2008.

I graduated in Software Engineering at University of Vigo. Honestly, I love hacking and all about Computer Science.

Currently, I'm working at <a href="http://www.farfetch.com/" rel="external">Farfetch</a>, an amazing company focused on Luxury fashion as an Infrastructure Architect.

I love read hardcover books (the iPad is good, but old fashion books are better), go to the cinema, hangout with my friends, CrossfitÂ® and run too.

If you want to know about me and you're not the NSA, you can follow me on Twitter and GitHub (links at the top of the site).

"O Vao" beach, (You can find it in my home city, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigo" rel="external">Vigo</a>), great summers I spent there :)
