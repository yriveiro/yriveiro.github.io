**Author:** Tim Marshall

**Rating:** 8/10

I liked this book; it provides a lot of information and
insights about current frontiers and the importance of
the foreign policy and its impact over the years.

It helped me understand why the world is the way it
is and is a very interesting read to comprehend the
conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
