**Author:** Charles Petzol

**Rating:** 10/10

Without a doubt, one of the best book I have ever read.

This book will guide you from Morse Code to building a
small computer just by reading its content.

Note: I strongly recommend you havving a pencil and notebook
nearby when you read this book.

A 2nd edition was published with new content, and one
interesting addition, a [website](https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/)
with animations assist the reading. I haven't had the pleasure of
reading the 2nd edition yet. In addition to substantially revised and updated content,
the new chapters include:

- Chapter 18: Letâ€™s Build a Clock!
- Chapter 21: The Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Chapter 22: Registers and Busses
- Chapter 23: CPU Control Signals
- Chapter 24: Jumps, Loops, and Calls
- Chapter 28: The World Brain
