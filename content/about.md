Hi,

My name is Yago, I'm a spaniard living in the great city of
[Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto) since 2008.

I graduated in Software Engineering at University of Vigo. I love hacking and all
related with Computer Science. I have a guilty pleasure of understand why thing are
how they are and a tick for hardcopy books.

I make Software for a living for more than 16 years, [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
is my gun of choice and related with languages, I use the one that the occasion
requires to achieve what is _good enough_ for the problem I need to solve.

If what I write intests you in any way, you can follow me on X [@yriviero](https://twitter.com/yriveiro)
and on GitHub [@yriveiro](https://github.com/yriveiro).<https://github.com/yriveiro>).

"O Vao" beach, (You can find it in my home city, [Vigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigo),
great summers I spent there ðŸ¥¹
