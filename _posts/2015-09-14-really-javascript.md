Good talk about JavaScript by Douglas Crockford.

This talk is relatively *old* (2010) but the principles described are valid nowadays.

Interesting point of view about the web and the implications of HTML5 in its future. In 2010 Crockford, basically, defends that HTML5 was broken and should be reset.

-	Are his arguments valid today?
-	Is XSS issue solved?

Good questions to do some research.
