Today, I release my little Frankenstein project, my personal blog. That is an old idea that for one reason or another I never did.

A few weeks ago, I found a blogging platform written in node.js called [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). I did some research in the source code and the deployment process an I said: "Ghost, I choose you".

![ghost](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/511/603/1bcfb49b1f869d411f6e5ec8182ffe83_large.jpg?1365807264)

Why?

* The deployment process is straightforward, and if you don't want have any work at all, you can use their cloud, for one small blog (10K views/month) is about $5 (4€ more or less).

* The source code look nice, and as a Software Engineer, I care about with how things that I use are implemented under the hood.

* The roadmap is full with new ideas and features, for me, this represent the health status in a project.

* Very simple to use.

As a pet project this blog has 2 main goals, first share my ideas, pains and all that I could remember and I wanna share with the world and a second, but for me more important, practice one of my worst enemy, English.

As you can notice, I'm not a native speaker and my speech is full of ugly errors, (all improvements are welcome :D) but I can give up in my path to improve my weakness.

Ok, this is my first post in my little Frankenstein project.

Let's the show begin.
